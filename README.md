# Splatsh
The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)-based command-line shell for everyone!

## Why. Just why. Another shell?
Well, yes but actually no. This isn't meant to _replace_ any of your normal shells, like bash, zsh or fish. This is just a fun experiment. If you want to use it, then do, but beware of the risks.

These 'risks' include:
- no stdin pipe
- no `-c` flags
- being asked to contribute

## __This is _NOT_ finished.**_
This is absolutely not fit for any normal day-to-day use. Check this spot in a few hundred years to see if it's ready yet.


## Seems cool, how 2 contribute?
Simply open a pull request with the feature you want to add. Be careful though, things in [Issue #3](https://github.com/nearlysplat/splatsh/issues/3) _are **not** to be touched._
